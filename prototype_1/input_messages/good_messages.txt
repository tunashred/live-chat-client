Nah bro, I swear I set my alarm… it just chose violence and didn’t go off.
Wait, you’re telling me spaghetti is just wet breadsticks? I need a moment.
Bruh, I tried that "drink more water" thing and now I live in the bathroom.
Oh, so you mean to tell me that narwhals are REAL but unicorns aren’t? Explain yourself.
No, no, listen—if "tomorrow never comes" and "yesterday never returns," then technically, we're stuck in a loop.
Bro, I walked into a room and forgot why I went in there… again. My brain is on demo mode.
I’d help you move, but last time I carried a couch, I pulled a muscle I didn’t even know I had.
Oh, for real? You had a bad day? I just tried to unlock my front door with my car key.
Pfft, you think that's bad? I once said "love you" to a cashier by accident.
Bro, I don’t “sleep.” I just close my eyes and hope for the best.
Dude, I just realized I’ve been using my microwave as a timer instead of actually heating things up.
NO WAY, you also call your dog like he's in trouble just to give him a treat?? Soulmates.
You ever wake up so tired you just sit on the edge of the bed contemplating existence? Yeah, that was me this morning.
Oh, you’re tired? I once tried to text “I’m on my way” and autocorrect changed it to “I’m on my whale.”
No, I didn’t ignore your text! I read it, mentally replied, and then forgot like an idiot.
Bro, I just found out my childhood teddy bear’s name is spelled differently than I thought my whole life. I feel betrayed.
WAIT, YOU MICROWAVE YOUR PIZZA?? Sir, jail. Straight to jail.
What do you mean “be normal”?? This is the standard premium edition of me.
Oh yeah? Well, I just waved at a security camera thinking it was a person, so I win the awkward award today.
Bro, I just realized I’ve been spelling “definitely” wrong for like, 10 years. No one told me.
You ever eat a snack so good you just sit there staring at it like it’s the best decision you’ve ever made?
